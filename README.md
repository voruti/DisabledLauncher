# Disabled Launcher

An Android app that disables other unused apps by using ADB/[Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku), while still
allowing convenient access to them when they are needed.

## Future ideas (backlog):

- [ ] "long-term" app list, intended for apps being active for some days
- [ ] Widget wrappers/placeholders
- [ ] Intent filters (open in app) placeholders
