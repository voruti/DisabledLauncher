# Disabled Launcher

An Android app that disables other unused apps by using
ADB/[Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku), while still
allowing convenient access to them when they are needed.

## Future ideas (backlog):

- [ ] Widget wrappers/placeholders
- [ ] Intent filters (open in app) placeholders
